## 🎯 What's This All About?

### The Goal
Merge two repositories to create one amazing application:

**UiAmrikyy** (Beautiful desktop OS UI)  
**+**  
**Amrikyy-Agent** (Production-ready backend)  
**=**  
**Unified App** (Best of both worlds!)

### The Approach
**Frontend-Preserving Backend Integration**
- Keep: UiAmrikyy's beautiful UI (100%)
- Replace: Backend with Amrikyy-Agent's production backend (100%)
- Connect: Frontend to real APIs
- Result: Desktop OS with real AI, database, and features
